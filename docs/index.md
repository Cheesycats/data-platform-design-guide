#Build user centred products for the NHS Federated Data Platform
##How to use this guide
By using this guide, you can ensure that the user of your product encounters a familiar and easy-to-use interface, and will find it similar to other FDP products they use.

It’s important to ensure that all products can be used as intended and that end users understand the interface and can get the outcome they need easily. This guide contains clear and consistent guidelines on core design elements, including colour palettes, typography, and layout structures.

In the final version you will also find screengrabs of templates to be used in Workshop - with annotations to explain which Workshop widgets to use.

##Top five things to consider
###1. Core colours

- <p class="inline-container">NHS Blue<span class="colour-rect" style="--colour: #005EB8; --txt_clr: white">#005EB8</span> Use this for logos, straps</p>

- <p class="inline-container">White<span class="colour-rect" style="--colour: #FFFFFF; --txt_clr: black">#FFFFFF</span> Use this for labels on buttons, NHS logo, headings on NHS blue</p>


###2.	Type sizes  
- the FDP uses type sizes Small, Medium and Large. We believe that the “small” size is unreadable for many users, therefore would recommend only using Medium and Large
- if specifying text in points or pixels, the optimal default font size for maximum readability for most users is 19px on large screens and 16px on small screens. Font size should not be smaller than size 10px.

###3.	Using colours  
Users think that when colour is used it is trying to convey information, so make sure the use of colour is intentional and consistent. Don't use colour just for decoration.

- see the section on Guidance on use of colour - to ensure consistent experience for users across all products 
- a proportion of users cannot differentiate different colours. To communicate with people who cannot see well or distinguish colours, you may need to: 
    - ensure that the contrast between colours is high enough using a colour tool
    - word things differently
    - use more than one visual cue, for example, text and an icon as well as colour 

###4.	Headings  
- make them meaningful, let readers know where they are/ what they are looking at 
- use “Sentence Case” for headings  
- make proper use of the Semantic page structure used in Workshop to make it readable by screen-readers

###5.	Links 
- links should open in the same window. There are 2 exceptions to this:
    - for instructions or other help with filling in a form (for example, a date picker)
    - if a user has logged into a secure site and the link would take them away from it
- make links meaningful, do not say “click here”. Provide context where it will take the user
- when a link will open a new tab for the user, add the words “opens in new tab” (or window) to the line

##Guidance on use of colour 
Users find colours indicative of meaning, therefore, we need to use colour intentionally and consistently

- **Accessibility:** make sure that what the colour is "saying" is available in other ways. To communicate with people who cannot see well or distinguish colours, you may need to:
    - word things differently 
    - use more than one visual cue, for example, text and an icon as well as colour

## Written Content
 
Use plain language. Research has shown that most people prefer to read plain English, and that the more specialist a person's knowledge is, the greater their preference. 

Our content is factual, neutral and unambiguous. We do not use metaphors - we say what we mean.

- spell out abbreviations and acronyms when first used
- don’t use jargon, rather than saying ‘free text’ say ‘notes’
- use short sentences - up to 20 words, and short paragraphs - up to 3 sentences
- write descriptive headings and subheadings 
- do not assume our audience will be familiar with the topic 

### When to use Capital letters
- use “Sentence Case” for headings (capital letter at the start of the sentence only, except for proper nouns e.g. names, company names)
- use “Title case” for the names of organisations, training programmes, schemes, and specialties (Capital letters for each word in a title)


### Tone of voice
- use the active voice - "find a pharmacy" rather than "a pharmacy can be found" 
- there’s usually no need to say "please" or "please note"
- there’s usually no need to say thank you
- say "sorry" if something serious has gone wrong - for example, the service has stopped working completely

## Numbers, Dates and time
- we use numerals for numbers (including 1 and 2)
- for numbers over 999, use a comma for clarity (for example, 1,000)
- always start with zero for values less than 1 (for example: 0.75 not .75)
- ensure negative values are indicated by a minus sign (for example: -65)
- we spell out "one" when it means "a" or to avoid repeating a word

### Dates 
- always use UK format for dates, do not use American format
- use this format for dates: 6 August 2018
- if you need to include the day of the week, use this format: Wednesday 6 August 2018
- short dates should be formatted DD/MM/YYYY 

### Time 
- "5:30pm", not "1730hrs"
- "midnight" not "00:00"
- "midday" not "12 noon", "noon" or "12pm"
- "6 hours 30 minutes", not "6.5hrs" 

## Images 
### Informative images
- do not use text in images 
- provide alt-text when images convey meaning or information.
- keep alt-text to around 125 characters or 2 sentences 
- if there's important information that you cannot fit in 125 characters (for example, you're describing a complex chart), include this information in the alt-text or consider linking to more information for screen reader users. 

### Decorative images 
- avoid them in data products unless they convey useful information
- if an image is decorative, give it a null text alternative like this: (alt="") 

### Product tiles
- if there is a need to add an image to a product tile, ensure that it is a copyright free image that is meaningful to users, and not a screengrab of a product page

## Data Visualisations 
- every chart or other visualization must have a title. This benefits all users, and particularly those using a screen-reader. [type size medium]
- keep axis titles as short as possible [type size medium]
- category names on a chart axis or in a legend should be clear and concise [type size medium]
- for data from two or more time periods, put the older values before the newer values 

### Chart colours 
To be used in this order (if more than 12 then start again from the first colour):

- <p class="inline-container">One colour chart<span class="colour-rect" style="--colour: #005EB8; --txt_clr: white">#005EB8</span></p>
